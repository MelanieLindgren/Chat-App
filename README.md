# Chat App 🙋‍♀️💬

As the name suggests, Chat App is a one room chat app with realtime data updates. Inspired by [Fireship's chat app tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQyrwxMPm88) on YouTube, I too use React as frontend with a backend in Firebase.

## Features
In the Chat app, not only can you chat with EVERYONE else by simply signing in with Google, you can also change your nickname and choose from a whopping 5 colors to style your chat bubble, which in turn changes the color of your send button. 

Additionally, clicking on your or other people's messages will show the time the message was sent and the name of the user who sent the message. If clicking isn't your cup of tea, you can toggle the switches under the display option witch makes them visible at all times.
